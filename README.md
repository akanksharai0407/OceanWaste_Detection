# OceanWaste_Detection
Detecting and Classifying Ocean Trash using YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN

## Project Description
This project uses object detection models (YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN) to detect and classify ocean waste in real-world images using the TACO dataset. We compare their accuracy, speed, and performance to identify which model is best suited for environmental applications.

##  Models Used
- YOLOv5
- Faster R-CNN

##  Folders
- `data/` - Dataset files (images + annotations)
- `notebooks/` - Colab notebooks for training/evaluation
- `models/` - Trained models
- `results/` - Visualizations, predictions
- `report/` - Final report and slides
- `scripts/` - Custom scripts (data splits, visualization)

##  Team
- Akanksha Rai (VR528177)
- Ashirbek Zhanel (VR527705)

##  Goals
- Train both models on ocean waste data
- Evaluate with mAP, precision, recall, and visual comparisons
- Perform ablations and suggest real-world use cases
